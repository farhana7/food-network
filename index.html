            <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic
                noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and
                consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for
                healthy diet.

                A healthy diet comprises a combination of different foods. These include:

                Staples like cereals (wheat, barley, rye, maize or rice) or starchy tubers or roots (potato, yam, taro
                or cassava).
                Legumes (lentils and beans).
                Fruit and vegetables.
                Foods from animal sources (meat, fish, eggs and milk).
